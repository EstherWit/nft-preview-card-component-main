## My process
I first wrote the HTML by embedding the pre-written text in the appropriate elements.
After that, I styled it, and whenever I faced challenges—which happened many times—I consulted friends and ChatGPT for help.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned how much the margins and padding of a container can affect its child elements.
Mostly, I just used trial and error until I achieved the desired interface.

I had to remove margins from some elements to make things align properly, while for others I had to add margins and padding to get the layout right.
